# ðŸ§ª Lyme Disease Controversy Explorer (Streamlit App)

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview  
This is an interactive **Streamlit app** designed to showcase how insights from text data can be explored visually.  
It uses **Word Clouds, LDA Topic Modeling, and Clustering** to simulate research into controversies surrounding Lyme disease, based on synthetic abstracts.  

ðŸ‘‰ Try the live app here: [Lyme Disease Explorer](https://lymeanalysisapp-pqjhfx2j5xmdykbxzjo7ya.streamlit.app/)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- Word Cloud generation from synthetic abstracts  
- LDA Topic Modeling for latent themes  
- Clustering to group similar abstracts  
- Interactive exploration in the Streamlit interface  


## ðŸ”— Related Work  
This app **complements my ML analysis of Lyme disease classification**, where I applied clustering and feature exploration techniques to scientific abstracts.
